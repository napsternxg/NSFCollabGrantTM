Topic modelling of NSF Collaborative Grant Data
===============================================

This analysis was done as a part of the project for the course on [LIS 590 MTL Informetrics](http://oce.illinois.edu/Section/54302/120138)

Motivation
----------

To find patters of important words in NSF collaborative grants on per division basis.

Usage
-----

 * Get the CSV data
 * Run `python text2corpus_dict.py`
 * Run `python topicModels.py tm`. This will train the topic models and save in the folder corpus_dict_data.
 * Run `python topicModels.py print`.This will print all the topic models for each Division on the screen. 

Results
-------

Some interesting topic models on the words in the NSF Collaborative grant abstracts. The data is after 2007.
